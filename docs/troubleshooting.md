# Troubleshooting

## Device Cannot Be Reached

- Verify host/IP, port, SSL and certificate settings.
- Confirm Home Assistant host can reach the UNAS host on the local network.

## Discovery Card Keeps Appearing

- Check diagnostics discovery health fields (confidence/conflicts/source).
- In mixed VLAN or multi-interface environments, manual confirmation can still
  be expected by design.

## Authentication Fails

- Validate local account credentials or API key validity.
- Reconfigure entry credentials and reload the config entry.

## Monitoring Works But Controls Fail

- This usually indicates permission scope differences on local endpoints.
- Verify account/API key privileges for fan/update/snapshot/backup actions.

## Snapshot Targets Missing Or Unavailable

- Enable snapshot controls in options/reconfigure.
- Verify snapshot endpoint permissions for the configured identity.
- Use inventory status attributes to distinguish unsupported vs. permission
  failures.

## Device Powered Off

- Offline state is expected and should not become a repair storm.
- Use Wake-on-LAN when configured to recover normal monitoring.
